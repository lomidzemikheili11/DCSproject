                    <p>We are obligated as merchants to inform you of the EU/UK right of withdrawal in very specific
                        legal terms, which you can find below. If these should in any way differ from our more informal
                        wording, the below terms shall prevail towards any EU/UK consumer.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="P">
                    <p>As a DCS World user domiciled in a European Union member country or the United Kingdom of Great
                        Britain and Northern Ireland, you have the right to withdraw from any purchase on our E-Shop
                        without giving any reason.</p>
                    <p>For any digital content purchased online, you have agreed upon checkout that the withdrawal
                        period will expire 14 days after you purchase such digital content or when you start downloading
                        the content for the first time, whichever is sooner.</p>
                    <p>To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform Eagle Dynamics SA of your decision to
                        withdraw from the purchase by an unequivocal statement. You may attach the model withdrawal form
                        available below, but it is not mandatory.</p>
                    <p>The easiest way to exercise your right of withdrawal is by using the support form on our website
                        at https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/support/. If you do so, we will communicate to you
                        an acknowledgement of receipt of such a withdrawal on a durable medium (e.g. by e-mail) without
                        delay.</p>
                    <p>To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning
                        your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.</p>
